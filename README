A data driven simulation project aimed to identify and predict critical
threats for the availability of primary health-care providers.

There are two parts to this project. Understanding criticality of the system and
the danger represented by its components (primary HCPs) and understanding
susceptibility of the system and its components to shocks, i.e. unavailability
of certain HCPs
